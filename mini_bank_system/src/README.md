### Problem Statement: Mini Bank System with Transaction Tracking

**Objective:**
Develop a console-based Mini Bank System that allows users to manage their bank account by performing basic operations like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing transaction history. The program should reinforce fundamental Rust concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, loops, and arrays.

**Requirements:**
1. **Check Balance:** Allow users to view their current account balance.
2. **Deposit Money:** Enable users to deposit money into their account. Track each deposit transaction.
3. **Withdraw Money:** Enable users to withdraw money from their account, ensuring they cannot withdraw more than their current balance. Track each withdrawal transaction.
4. **View Transactions:** Allow users to view the history of their last five transactions.
5. **Exit:** Provide an option for users to exit the program.

**Constraints:**
- Use an array to store the last five transactions.
- Implement user input handling to select different operations.
- Ensure that the program runs in a loop, allowing multiple operations until the user decides to exit.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully.

**Expected Outcome:**
The program will display the current balance, allow deposits and withdrawals while tracking the last five transactions, and provide an option to exit the program. This should give the user a clear and practical tool while reinforcing the basics of Rust programming.
